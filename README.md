DSP Debating Timer
==================

Timer for debates in BPS format. Default time is 5 or 7 minutes, but you can enter a different time. It has a visual and audible signal (if sound is enabled) one minute after start and one minute before the end, two signals at the end of the time and then three signals at regular intervals. Those are the usual signals at debates in Germany (and I think BPS debates in general).

It has the color and logo of the [Debating Society Paderborn](http://www.debatingsocietypaderborn.de/) (DSP).

The program doesn't have a whole lot of features, but it's good enough for our debates. I might add a few new features, if we need them. If you have any suggestions, let me know.

The app keeps the screen on while it is running. This is intended behaviour (you want to see the screen, don't you?), but it can drain the battery, if you forget to turn it off! Of course, you can still turn off (and turn on) the screen by pressing the power button.

INSTALL
-------

You can simply download the file [DSP-Debating-Timer.apk](https://github.com/BBBSnowball/Debating-Timer/raw/master/DSP-Debating-Timer.apk) and install that on your phone or tablet. You may have to enable non-market applications to do so.

If you want to change it or compile the app yourself, you need the Android SDK. If you have Eclipse with the plugins for Android development, you can import the project in this folder. If you want to build it from the command line, please confer the SDK documentation. In both cases, you must sign the application, if you want to install it on other phones (like the APK file that I provide).

LICENSE
-------

I publish my code under the [BSD license](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause). This means that you can use it in your programs and you don't have to publish the source code of your program. However, you must mention the author (that's me) and the Debating Society Paderborn in an appropriate place. Please see the license text for details.

If you take the application as a whole, please keep our logo.

I use some work by other people:
* The idea (and probably part of the code) for the FontFitTextView is from a Stackoverflow thread (link is in the code). I'm not sure about the license for that part.
* I downloaded the sound file from [hamsterrepublic.com](http://rpg.hamsterrepublic.com/ohrrpgce/Free_Sound_Effects) ([Metal_Hit.ogg](http://rpg.hamsterrepublic.com/wiki-images/7/72/Metal_Hit.ogg)). The page says that it is free. You can find other sounds on that page, if you don't like the default one.

(I wrote the program a year ago and only recently decided to publish it, so I don't remember all the details. Next time, I will make better notes...)
